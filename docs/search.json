We wrote about the purpose and design of the securities lending facility, why usage was so high, and a stylised example of the shorts in the bonds-futures basis that were underlying lots of the borrowing."

It outlined the purpose and design of the TFF, as well as how it had been used to date. I had spent the early months of the pandemic setting up the TFF, and I learnt a lot about facility design in the process."
