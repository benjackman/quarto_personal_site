It outlined the purpose and design of the facility, as well as how it had been used to date.\nIn March 2020, I returned to Australia from full-time study 6 months earlier than expected as the severity of the pandemic became clear. I offered to give my colleagues a hand with their workload, expecting to do some odd jobs, but ended up helping set up the TFF. This became most of my work for two years, and was an enjoyable experience where I learned a lot.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
