In 2022 my colleague Ahmet Aziz and I wrote in the RBA Bulletin about the [AOFM and RBA's securities lending](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2022/dec/the-rba-and-aofm-securities-lending-facilities.html), which had grown to very large levels that year. This article discusses the purpose and design of the securities lending facilities, why their usage had grown so much, and a stylised example of the bonds-futures basis trade underlying some of the activity. 

## August 2021 - Use of the TFF

In August 2021 we provided an update in the *Statement on Monetary Policy* on usage of the Term Funding Facility (more detail see below). This outlined how most of the funding available under the TFF was drawndown, and includes a table of the top 10 biggest borrowers.

In December 2020, some of my colleagues and I put out an article in the RBA Bulletin on the RBA's [Term Funding Facility](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2020/dec/the-term-funding-facility.html) (TFF). It outlined the purpose and design of the facility, as well as how it had been used to date.

In March 2020, I returned to Australia from full-time study 6 months earlier than expected as the severity of the pandemic became clear. I offered to give my colleagues a hand with their workload, expecting to do some odd jobs, but ended up helping set up the TFF. This became most of my work for two years, and was an enjoyable experience where I learned a lot.
